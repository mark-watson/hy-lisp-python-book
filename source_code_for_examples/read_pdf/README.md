# Convert PDF files to text for use in Audio Reader programs

I like to convert PDFs to text, removing some text artifacts, so that I can listen to papers while walking. The Audio reading app on my iPhone does a poor job reading through footnotes, tables, etc. so I would like to automatically clean up text as much as possible.

NOTE: this is very much a work in progress.
