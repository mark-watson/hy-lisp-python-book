# Manuscript and Example Code for my book "A Lisp Programmer Living in Python-Land: The Hy Programming Language"

The code examples have been updated in August 2025 to run with Hy version 1.1 (hy-1.010)

## Code examples

The examples are in the directory **hy-lisp-python-book/source_code_for_examples**.

I am in the process of adding new examples (mostly LLM) and deprecating old examples. The old examples will be moved to the directory **hy-lisp-python-book/source_code_for_examples/OLD_EXAMPLES_NO_LONGER_IN_BOOK** and removed from the book.

As I am updating this book in August 2025, the latest version of Hy is 1.1.0:

```
$ hy
Hy 1.1.0 (Business Hugs) using CPython(main) 3.13.3 on Darwin
=> 
```

You can purchase the book at [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/hy-lisp-python) or read the book online for free. I offer free updates to new editions to all of my books purchased on leanpub.

## Book Content

This book covers many programming topics using the Lisp language Hy that compiles to Python AST and is compatible with code, libraries, and frameworks written in Python. The main topics we will cover and write example applications for are:

- Relational and graph databases
- Web app development
- Web scraping
- Accessing semantic web and linked data sources like Wikipedia, DBpedia, and Wikidata
- Automatically constructing Knowledge Graphs from text documents, semantic web and linked
data
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning
- OpenAI GPT APIs
- LangChain for chaining Large Language Model operations
- 

Please note that this repo may also occasionally contain examples that are a work in progress (these directories conatin a file named **NOT_YET_IN_BOOK.md**).
