# Natural Language Processing

I have been working in the field of NLP since 1985 so I 'lived through' the revolutionary change in NLP that occurred in sincd 2014: deep learning results out-classed results from previous symbolic methods.

I will not cover older symbolic methods of NLP here, rather I refer you to my previous books [Practical Artificial Intelligence Programming With Java](https://leanpub.com/javaai), [Loving Common Lisp, or the Savvy Programmer's Secret Weapon](https://leanpub.com/lovinglisp), and [Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/haskell-cookbook).

You will learn how to apply both DL and NLP in two stages: develop low level "small feature" implementations to understand the underlying technology, and use state of the art full-feature libraries. You will need some math background for the first stage so if you are not interested or don't have the required background, you can still learn to effectively use these technologies by just studying through the second stages where we use industry standard libraries.

TBD - update previous intro!!
