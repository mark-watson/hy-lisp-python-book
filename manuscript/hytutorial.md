# Introduction to the Hy Language

The [Hy programming language](http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/) is a Lisp language that inter-operates smoothly with Python. We start with a few interactive examples that I encourage you to experiment with as you read. Then we will look at Hy data types and commonly used built in functions that are used in the remainder of this book.

I assume that you know at least a little Python and more importantly the Python ecosystem and general tools like **pip**.

Please start by installing Hy in your current Python environment:

        pip install git+https://github.com/hylang/hy.git
