# Preface

I have been using Lisp languages professionally since 1982 and have written books covering the Common Lisp and Scheme languages. This book covers many programming topics using the Lisp language **Hy** that compiles to Python AST and is compatible with code, libraries, and frameworks written in Python. The main topics we will cover and write example applications for are:

- Relational databases
- Web app development
- Web scraping
- Accessing semantic web and linked data sources like Wikipedia, DBpedia, and Wikidata
- Automatically constructing Knowledge Graphs from text documents, semantic web and linked data
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

This is a hands-on book! I expect you, dear reader, to follow along with the examples as you read this book. I assume that you know some Python and know how to use the command line tools **python** and **pip** and use a virtual Python environment like [Anaconda (**conda**)](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [**virtualenv**](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Personally I prefer **conda** but you can use any Pyhton setup you like as long as you have a few packages installed:

Youi can install the current stable version oy **Hy** using:

        pip install git+https://github.com/hylang/hy.git
