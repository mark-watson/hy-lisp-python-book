# Responsible Web Scraping

I put the word "Responsible" in the chapter title to remind you that just because it is easy (as we will soon see) to pull data from web sites, it is important to respect the property rights of web site owners and abide by their terms and conditions for use. This [Wikipedia article on Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) provides a good overview of using copyright material.

The web scraping code we develop here uses the Python BeautifulSoup Python library and URI libraries.
