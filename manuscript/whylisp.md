# Why Lisp?

Now that we have learned the basics of the Hy Lisp language in the last chapter, I would like to move our conversation to a broader question of why we would want to use Lisp. I want to start with my personal history of why I turned to Lisp languages in the late 1970s for almost all of my creative and research oriented development and later transitioned to also using Lisp languages in production.
