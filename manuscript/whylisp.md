# Why Lisp?

Now that we have learned the basics of the Hy Lisp language in the last chapter, I would like to move our conversation to a broader question of why we would want to use Lisp. I want to start with my personal history of why I turned to Lisp languages in the late 1970s for almost all of my creative and research oriented development and later transitioned to also using Lisp languages in production.

## I hated the Water Fall Method in the 1970s

I graduated UCSB in the mid 1970s with a degree in Physics and took a job as a scientific programmer in the 100% employee owned company SAIC. My manager had a PhD in Computer Science and our team and the organization we were in used what is known as the water fall method where systems were designed carefully from the top down, carefully planned mostly in their entirety, and then coded up.
