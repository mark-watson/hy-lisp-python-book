# Why Lisp?

Now that we have learned the basics of the Hy Lisp language in the last chapter, I would like to move our conversation to a broader question of why we would want to use Lisp. I want to start with my personal history of why I turned to Lisp languages in the late 1970s for almost all of my creative and research oriented development and later transitioned to also using Lisp languages in production.

## I hated the Water Fall Method in the 1970s

I graduated UCSB in the mid 1970s with a degree in Physics and took a job as a scientific programmer in the 100% employee owned company SAIC. My manager had a PhD in Computer Science and our team and the organization we were in used what is known as the water fall method where systems were designed carefully from the top down, carefully planned mostly in their entirety, and then coded up. We, and the whole industry I would guess, wasted a lot of time with early planning and design work that had to be discarded or heavily modified after some experience implementing the system.

What would be better? I grew to love bottom up programming. When I was given a new project I would start by writing and testing small procedures for low level operations, things I was sure I would need. I then aggregated the functionality into higher levels of control logic, access to data, etc. Finally I would write the high level application.

I mostly did this for a while in FORTRAN and some Algol (I consulted on Saturdays at Salk Institute working on hooking up lab equipment to minicomputers).

I wanted a better programming language!

## First Introduction to Lisp

In the late 1970s I discovered a Lisp implementation on my company's DECsystem-10 timesharing computer. I had heard of Lisp in reading Bertram Raphael's book "THE THINKING COMPUTER. Mind Inside Matter" an I took to learning Lisp during my lunch hours. After a few months of Lisp experience I received permission to teach an informal lunch time class to teach anyone working in my building who wantd to to learn Lisp on our DECsystem-10.

Lisp is the perfect language to support the type of bottom up iterative programming style that I like.
