# Book Wrap Up

I love programming in Lisp languages but I often need to use Python libraries for Deep Learning and NLP. The Hy language is a good fit for me: it is simple to install along with the Python libraries that I use for my work and it is a fun language to write code in. Most importantly, Hy fits well with the type of iterative bottom-up REPL-based development that I prefer.

I hope that you enjoyed this short book and that at least a few things that you have learned here will both help you in your work and give you ideas for new personal projects.

Best regards,
